- Run `bundle install` from the root directory
- Run `rails db:migrate`
- Run `rails db:seed` to start using the app with some fake data
- Run `thin start --ssl` to start up a server
- In your browser, navigate to [localhost:3000/home](https://localhost:3000/home) (3000 is the default port number displayed when you start your server)
